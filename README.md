# TIGRESS: Trustful Inference of Gene REgulation using Stability Selection

This R package implements the TIGRESS method for gene regulatory network (GRN) 
inference from gene expression data.

TIGRESS formulates GRN inference as a sparse regression problem, and solves it 
with a LARS regression model combined with stability selection. Check reference 
below for more details.

To install TIGRESS from R, type:

```{r}
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github("jpvert/tigress")
```
